# The_Information_GrowthDataAnalyst

The Growth Analyst Challenge.ipynb file contains the answers to all 4 questions


Tools used: 

* I used Jupyter Notebooks to answer all questions. 
* Within these notebooks, I used Python:
	Libraries: 
			- Pandas for formating dataframes
			- SQLAlchemy to access SQL through the notebooks (SQLite)

* PgAdmin4 to admin the SQL database (PSQL). 
    - Created the PSQL schema, and wrote Question 4 query using PSQL
